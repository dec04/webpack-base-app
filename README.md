### How to:

Just clone this on webserver and run
```bash
npm install
```

When it done
use this for developer mode

```bash
npm run dev
```
for production
```bash
npm run build
```
for dev-server and hot reloading (on htpp://127.0.0.1:4200)

```bash
npm run start
```
for webpack-analyze (default on htpp://127.0.0.1:8888)

```bash
npm run stats
```


Ohter setting in **_package.json_** and webpack settings in **_webpack.config.js_**

That's all. Happy hacking. :heart_decoration:
