### How to:

Just clone this on webserver and run
```bash
npm install
```

When it done

```bash
npm run dev
```
for developer mode

```bash
npm run build
```
for production

```bash
npm run start
```
for dev-server

```bash
npm run stats
```
for webpack-analyze (default on htpp://127.0.0.1:8888)

Ohter setting in **_package.json_** and webpack settings in **_webpack.config.js_**

That's all. Happy hacking. :heart_decoration:
